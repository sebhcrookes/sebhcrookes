  <p>Currently, I am working on several projects. These are:</p>
  <a>‚Ä¢ <b>BambooOS</b> - An x86_64 operating system written in C++ and Assembly, with a UEFI bootloader.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;It supports:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä£ ACPI tables (MADT, MCFG)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä£ SMP support (multicore)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä£ GDT<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä£ Interrupts (including IOAPIC)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä£ PIC + PIT<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä£ Full Physical MM and Virtual MM support<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä£ PCI<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä£ AHCI + FAT32<br></a><br>
  <a>‚Ä¢ <b>Engine Simulator</b> - An engine simulator written in C++, aiming to be like that which was created by AngeTheGreat on YouTube<br></a>
  <a>‚Ä¢ <b>game.exe</b> - A game I'm working on which uses no external libraries or frameworks, other than ones written by me<br></a>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>I've been coding for ages now, and I'm currently cleaning up my OS for me to release it, and all the other tools I use to develop it, on here!</p>
