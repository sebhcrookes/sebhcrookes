  <p>Currently, I am working on several projects. These are:</p>
  <a>‚Ä¢ <b>BambooOS</b> - An operating system written in C++ and Assembly, with a UEFI bootloader<br></a>
  <a>‚Ä¢ <b>bamasm</b> - An assembler which turns assembly code for BambooOS into the machine code which the OS can execute<br></a>
  <a>‚Ä¢ <b>game.exe</b> - A game I'm working on which uses no external libraries or frameworks, other than ones written by me<br></a>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>I've been coding for ages now, and I'm currently cleaning up my OS for me to release it, and all the other tools I use to develop it, on here!</p>
