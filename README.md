  <p>Currently, I am working on several projects. The main ones are:</p>
  <a>â€¢ <b>BambooOS</b> - An x86_64 operating system written in C++ and Assembly. Click <a href="https://github.com/sebhcrookes/bamboo-os">here</a> for more<br></a>
  <a>â€¢ <b>Engine Simulator</b> - An engine simulator written in C++, aiming to produce an accurate engine sound through fluid and physics simulation<br></a>
  <a>â€¢ <b>game.exe</b> - A game I'm working on which uses no external libraries or frameworks, other than ones written by me<br></a>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>I've been coding for over 6 years now in Python, Java, C/C++, Go and other languages, so I have worked on many other projects such as <b>compilers</b>, <b>machine learning</b> projects and more. I am uploading my projects on here so that anyone interested can take a look!</p>
